## How to play
Blackjack is a game that the player draws a card until total value of player reaches 21. Every card has a number value. For example value of three of clubs is three. If the player's total value is greater than the total value of your opponet and if it is smaller than 21 or equal to 21, player will win. owever, there is a value limit which is '21'.If the player draws a card and if the total value of the player is larger than 21, player loses. There is one exceptional card which is named 'A' (ace). You are able to change the value of this card. You can take the value as 1 or 11. If the total value of your cards is larger than 21, then you can take the value of the ace as '1'. Otherwise it is concidered '11'.

## Rules
There are 2 options: hit or stand. If you want to draw a card, type 'hit'. If you want to keep your cards, type 'stand'. Each round, computer will ask you to hit or stand. When you type anything, computer will show you the total value of your cards. In the beggining, your opponet draws 2 card but you are not allowed to see one of them which is 'hidden card'. When you type stand, your opponet will draw cards and you will be able to see all of the cards of your opponet.
